# Project 1 - Thread scheduling with GTthreads

**Release Date: Aug 25**

**Due Date: Sep 15, 11:59 PM**

------

The goal of the project is to understand and implement the **credit scheduler** in a user-level threads library.
To do so you must modify the provided GTThreads library.
The library implements a O(1) priority scheduler and a priority co-scheduler for reference.

You may discuss ideas with colleagues in the class, but the project must be done **individually**.
Copying others is NEVER allowed for any reason.
